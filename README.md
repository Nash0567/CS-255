#CS-255: System Analysis and Design

##Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client for the DriverPass project was Liam, owner of DriverPass. In the DriverPass project, they were seeking improved online training and the ability for users to register for in-person driving training.

##What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did a good job of reading over the DriverPass interview transcript and collecting relevant and important information to establish the requirements and expectations of DriverPass.

##If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One area I believe I could improve is my Gantt chart. The Gantt chart is a great tool for visualizing deadlines and responsibilities of team members. I think it would have helped if I took more time making it more neat and easier to follow.

##How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Interpreting and understanding requirements is important to ensure the project meets all of the client needs. It is important to use efficient methods to collect requirements such as taking notes and asking questions.

##How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The first step in designing software is collecting requirements and analyzing them to establish the best way to implement them. This course taught me how to establish requirements and how to use several different modelling diagrams to help visualize processes within the system.
